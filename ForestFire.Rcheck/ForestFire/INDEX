find_infected_neighbors
                        Function to find for the point
                        infection_matrix[i,j] the neighbors that were
                        infected from all the 8 edges from a point in
                        the matrix For point (x, y) the points (x + 1,
                        y + 1), (x + 1, y), (x + 1, y + 1), (x, y + 1),

                        + 1, y + 1) are considered neighbors.
find_infected_neighbors_apply
                        Function to calculate for each point in the
                        infection_matrix the neighbors that were
                        infected from all the 8 edges For point (x, y)
                        the points (x + 1, y + 1), (x + 1, y), (x + 1,
                        y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y + 1),
                        (x + 1, y), and (x + 1, y + 1) are considered
                        neighbors.

find_infected_neighbors_vectorized
                        Function to calculate for each point in the
                        infection_matrix the neighbors that were
                        infected from all the 8 edges For point (x, y)
                        the points (x + 1, y + 1), (x + 1, y), (x + 1,
                        y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y + 1),
                        (x + 1, y), and (x + 1, y + 1) are considered
                        neighbors.
forest_fire_apply       Function to simulate a forest fire epidemic
                        model For infection_matrix[i, j] = 2, person is
                        unburnt; 1 for on fire; 0 for burnt out. An on
                        fire individual can only infect unburnt
                        individuals if they are neighbors.
forest_fire_commented   Function to simulate a forest fire epidemic
                        model For infection_matrix[i, j] = 2, person is
                        unburnt; 1 for on fire; 0 for burnt out. An on
                        fire individual can only infect unburnt
                        individuals if they are neighbors.

                        with points
forest_fire_rcpp        Simple function using Rcpp
forest_fire_vectorized
