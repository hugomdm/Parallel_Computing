\title{Function to simulate a forest fire epidemic model
For infection_matrix[i, j] = 2, person is unburnt; 1 for on fire; 0 for burnt out.
An on fire individual can only infect unburnt individuals if they are neighbors.}
\usage{
forest_fire_vectorized(infection_matrix, alpha, beta, pausing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{infection_matrix}{: main infection_matrix that maps an individual and 
its current state state (unburnt, on fire or burnt out)}

\item{pausing}{}

\item{alpha:}{probability of an infected individual of infecting each of its susceptible neighbors}

\item{beta:}{probability of an individual that was on fire and had a chance of 
affecting people of getting unburnt}
}
\value{
infection_matrix: returns the updated infection_matrix after the simulation
