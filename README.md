This package was made for the Parallel Computing projet for the Mastet Data Mining of University Lyon 2 in 2022. 
The package has the implementation a new code  



and the improvement of the existing **forest fire simulation** code from Chapter 21 (21.2.3 Forest fire model) of the 
(Jones, Maillardet & Robinson) "IntroductIon to Scientific Programming and Simulation using R" book. 
Finally, we created a package with all these implementations. 

This code is written on R with the help of some standard libraries. 

## How to Run: 

The testing code is in the code_to_test/ folder. 
With this code you can test both solution. 

First you just need to install the furvin package:
