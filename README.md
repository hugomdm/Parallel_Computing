## Projet Title: 

### FURVIN: Package for the Parallel Computing Project

## Projet Description: 

This package was made for the Parallel Computing projet for the Mastet Data Mining of University Lyon 2 in 2022. 

All functions are taken from the book (Jones, Maillardet & Robinson) "IntroductIon to Scientific Programming and Simulation using R".

First of all,  we have improved the existing **forest fire simulation** code from Chapter 21 (21.2.3 Forest fire model)
Then we implemented the simulations presented in Chapter 22 (22.6 Stock Prices)

Finally, we created a package with all these implementations. 

This code is written on R with the help of some standard libraries. 

## How to Run: 

The testing code is in the code_to_test/ folder. 
With this code you can test both solution. 

First you just need to install the furvin package:

  > install.packages("furvin_1.0.tar.gz")

and 
  > library(furvin)

afterwards you can run the testing codes.
